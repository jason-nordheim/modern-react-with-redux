# Modern React with Redux 

## Setup 

### Install 

Install create react application command line package: 

Code 
`npm install -g create-react-app`

What this does
* `npm` call node package manager from the command line 
* `install` tells node package manager that we are requesting an install 
* `-g` indicates that this install is to be global 

### Template Generation 

> Note: you may need to update your version of node to have `npx`, older versions do not have them 

Code 
`npx create-react-app <name>`

What this does
* `npx` calls node package manager 
* `create-react-app` tells the package manager that you want to use the install package `create-react-app`
* `<name>` indicates the directory name for which the tcreate react app cli should place files
